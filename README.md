## Requirements
This project is written in go.

https://golang.org/doc/install

# Installing git2go

This project requires git2go.v22, which in turn requires libgit2.  You will need to install a go and libgit2.  If you want SSH support with this application, ensure you have libssh installed as well.


```bash
go get -d gopkg.in/libgit2/git2go.v22
cd $GOPATH/src/gopkg.in/libgit2/git2go
git submodule update --init 
make install
```

# Installing yaml

This project also requires yaml.v2

```bash
go get gopkg.in/yaml.v2
```

# Installing RepoTsar

```bash
go get github.com/SearchSpring/RepoTsar
``` 


Usage
=====

Edit the repotsar.yml to configure you signature and repos.

```YAML
signature:
    name: "Your Name"
    email: email@address.com

repos:
    git2go:
        url: ssh://git@github.com/libgit2/git2go.git
        path: /tmp/git2go
        branch: master

```
(Reminder: YAML format is space indented, not tab)

Running repotsar without arguments will create paths if needed, clone repos if needed, and git pull.

--repos can be supplied to a comma seperated list of defined repos from your repotsar.yml to act on.

--branch BranchName will in addition to the above, create local branches in all repos being acted on.
